Overview
DAJ is an interactive, visual aid for studying distributed algorithms. Interactive, because you must explicitly specify every step of the interleaved execution sequence. Visual, because the state of the nodes is continuously displayed. Study aid, because they solve one of the most difficult problems encountered by students of these algorithms by automatically doing the necessary book-keeping. The program can create a log file of commands so that you can automatically replay scenarios until you understand them. Fourteen algorithms are current implemented, and you can implement other algorithms with only an elementary knowledge of Java. Visualizations are included for the virtual global structures contructed by some of the algorithms.
